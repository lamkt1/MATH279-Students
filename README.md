# MATH 279 - Spring 2026
Hello! I’m Professor Lam, and I’m excited to welcome you to this course. Linear algebra is the mathematical backbone of modern data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and this class will help you see why. We will learn how vectors, matrices, and linear transformations work as real-world data science tools through theory, visualization, and hands-on coding in Python.

**Course Student Learning Outcomes:**
- Compute matrices rank, determinant, and null space, using these properties to assess data structures and solve systems of linear equations. 
- Perform QR decomposition and work with orthogonal matrices to reduce dimensionality and transform data for regression models.

**Reference Textbooks:**
- Elementary Linear Algebra – Ron Larson
- Foundations of Linear Algebra for Data Science – Kang & Cho
